The videos in the static folder are videos recorded from fixed camera devices, thus the background does not change.
In these videos, the foreground objects are the only moving objects in the video while the background are static because the camera is fixed.
These videos are gotten from closed-circuit television (CCTV).



The Videos in the dynamic folder are videos recorded from moving camera devices, hence the background looks like it is in motion.
In these videos, the foreground objects are the moving objects as well as the background objects because the camera is in motion.
These videos are gotten from drone devices, pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ), dashboard cams, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) etc.
